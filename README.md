## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to support the business of a greengrocer.

The online store will start with three categories of products: fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and boxes.

The boxes are packed products that can contain anything. There is a product description field that can be used by the seller to describe the contents of each box.


## Features

### Existing Features

The users are able to list products by category or all products from all categories and then they can sort each list alphabetically or by price.

Browsing a list of products, the users can select a product and add it to the shopping bag, specifying the quantity.

The contents of the shopping bag are stored in the HTTP session that is established between the HTTP client (browser) and the HTTP server. By storing these contents in the HTTP session and making sure there is always a link to the checkout functionality, the web application allows the user to consolidate their purchase at any point after adding one or more products to the bag.

### Features Left to Implement

## Design

### User Stories

#### Phase 1

These are the users stories defined for the first phase of the project.

* USER STORY #1: Welcome Page - As a Site User I want to be able to view the welcome/landing page so that I can log in or create an account.
* USER STORY #2: Create account - As a Site User I want to be able to create an account so that I can log in to the website.
* USER STORY #3: Log in - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to log in to the website so that I can buy products.
* USER STORY #4: Recover password - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to recover my password in case I forget it, so that I can log in to the website.
* USER STORY #5: View list of products - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to view a list of products for each product category, so that I can select some products to purchase.
* USER STORY #6: View individual product details - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to view the title, the subtitle, the category, the description, the price and the image of each product, so that I can understand what I would be buying if I decided to buy this product.
* USER STORY #7: Sort the list of available products - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to sort products by title and price so that I can easily identify what I want to purchase.

### Wireframes
