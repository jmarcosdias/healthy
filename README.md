* USER STORY: Log in #3 - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to log in to the website so that I can search products, view a sorted list of products, buy products, view my order history, manage my payment information and manage my personal account.
* USER STORY: Recover password #4 - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to recover my password in case I forget it, so that I can log in to the website.
* USER STORY: View list of products #5 - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to view a list of products so that I can select some to purchase.
* USER STORY: View individual product details #6 - As a Registered Site User I want to be able to view the name, the category, the description, the price and the image of a product I have selected to view, so that I can understand what I would be buying if I decided to buy this product.
